## Introducion
This project aims to help music lovers, Spotify users, and aspiring artists explore the musical attributes of songs beyond the hidden algorithms of streaming services. It offers a transparent and educational alternative to genre browsing and algorithmic recommendations.

The project has four views and a search dashboard, allowing users to go from exploration to summary, from one track to a whole playlist. Users can easily find and add their favorite songs to a personalized selection.

The views are:

* Radar Chart: Shows the shared attributes of the user playlist.
* Music Recommendation Tree: Gives personalized song suggestions based on a user-selected track.
* Heatmap: Shows the patterns of musical attributes across different playlists.
* Boxplot: Shows the distribution of attributes in the user playlist.
* The project helps users discover new music, understand their preferences, and fit their mood or setting.
